2. area — in square meters (float)
3. price — in EGP (integer or float)

5. type — stick with (apartment, villa, twin house, town house, duplex) if any thing else not known null it
6. n_rooms — number of rooms (integer)

  [
      {
        "region": "...",
        "area": ...,
        "price": ...,

        "project": ...
        "down_payment": ...
        "installments" : ...
      }
    ]

- Output must be raw JSON only — no Markdown, no explanations, no code fences.
- Not every message can contain a unit info, maybe a trash/unrelated data
